Assign any of the Repair groups ('User' 'Full Access') to the users,
in order to enable the repair menus.

To do so, you need to:

#. Go on 'Settings' -> 'Users & Companies' -> 'Users'.
#. Create a new user or select an already existing one.
#. In the tab 'Access Rights', at the 'Application Accesses' paragraph,
   set a group in the 'Repair' category.
